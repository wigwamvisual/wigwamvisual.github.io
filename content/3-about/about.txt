With a background in art and design Troy completed a degree in architecture at Plymouth University, then went on to specialise in 3D visualisation. Having always had a passion for digital art and photography, he began freelancing as an architectural visualiser before going on to work in London at Hawkins\Brown architects as an in-house digital artist, working alongside the 200+ strong architectural team. Working alongside industry leaders, he quickly gained a wealth of experience and knowledge, giving him the skills and expertise to begin Wigwam visual.

Originally from Southeast England, Troy has previously spent winters in the Italian Dolomites, summers working on the remote Scilly Isles and now lives in Kitsilano, Vancouver.
