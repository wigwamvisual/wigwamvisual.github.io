Title: Bishops Stortford

----

Description: These images supported a planning application for new boarding houses within a woodland setting at Bishops Stortford school. All 3D trees were placed to match a tree survey and various views were generated to ensure the proposal was not visually intrusive to neighbouring properties.  At the heart of the proposal is a rain garden which became the feature of the key image.
