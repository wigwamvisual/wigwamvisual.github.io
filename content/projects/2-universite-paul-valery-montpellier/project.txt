Title: Greenford PRS Scheme

----

Description: A series of images created for a private rental sector development in Greenford, London. The images highlight the social environment of the scheme and the relationship with the canal, greenery and existing listed buildings. The project started from a series of Microstation models, which were then built upon to arrive at the final scene.
