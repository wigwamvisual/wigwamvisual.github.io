Title: Tower project

----

Description: Images and animation highlighting a tech hub office tower proposal and train station entrance situated on the ground floor concourse. The use of light, such as the animated LED screen, is integral to the scheme - images show the proposal in a wet and futuristic setting to accentuate these features. The project was started with a simple massing model which was transformed into a fully modeled, lit and textured scene. Working through many design iterations with the architects, the final images were then created.
