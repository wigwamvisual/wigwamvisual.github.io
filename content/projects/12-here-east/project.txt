Title: Here East

----

Description: A series of images were created to convey the design of the breakout meeting pods at the Here East development in Stratford.  Three unique pods with bespoke panelling of either fabric, timber or metal were created. Working alongside the architects to aid the design development by testing materials, panel layouts and styles a final design and imagery was reached.
