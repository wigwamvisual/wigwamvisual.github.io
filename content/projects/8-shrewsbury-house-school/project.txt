Title: Shrewsbury House School

----

Description: A series of images were required for planning permission and to convey the design to the client. The proposal was shown in context with the existing buildings to highlight the continuation of the gable end language. Due to the constraints of the site, camera matching was a challenge. After visiting the site, taking photographs and by using a collage of multiple images, the photography was matched with the 3D model.
