Title: Hackney Residential

----

Description: A series of images were created to support a planning application. We went to site to take the photography before camera matching.  The scheme is predominantly made up from corten steel so it was important this material was accurately represented. Having worked from a simple Sketchup model, further details were added before lighting and texturing. Working with the architects throughout the planning process a number of further images were created with a quick turnaround.
