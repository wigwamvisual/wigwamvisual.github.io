Title: 1188 West Georgia

----

Description: 

Marketing images created for a renovation to the existing 1188 West Georgia, Vancouver tower. An proposed extension to the ground floor to include new retail units and a roof terrace. Views were created at different times of day to  capture the various identities and uses of the site. The context and existing tower were modelled and textured to accurately capture lighting and reflections in different conditions.
